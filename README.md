Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self-taught front-end developer with a mix-matched background in *music, psychology* and as an *entrepreneur* of my own business. 

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are: She/They

I'm currently working as part of the IT Support Team for **Robert Bosch** :de: after graduating Laboratoria, an intensive 6-month long bottcamp that helps women kickstart their career in the tech world.

I believe that it is our responsability as developers to shine a new light on technology as a human-comprehensive and intuitive tool to solve the new challenges we face everyday and make it accessible to everyone.

I'm currently learning about project management :chart:

A team manager for our personal-development coordinator in Laboratoria. Keep track of the personal and professional growth of your team with a clean-cut interface.

My role here was as the UI researcher and developer.

My first-ever dip into game development. 

The premise is simple: you're a chicken trying to dodge meteorites coming from space, the longer you stay alive the longer your score is.

Available for Android only.

This was one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult due to having to go from Javascript to C# and learning how game engines work in less than a week but in the end, it was very rewarding.

You can download the game [here](https://bit.ly/2JKtsbm "here") <br /><br />

I wanted to make a project for my little nephew who was 4 at the time.

After some reasearch, turns out that tic-tac-toe is a very recommended game due to several cognitive processed children develop at this stage:

- The temporal perception of the game, that is that only the first player to complete it, wins
- They learn how to predict their opponent's movements, in order to learn to block them
- Once they've successfully learned to coordinate how to block and how to get the 3 figures in a row, they can develop strategies to win. This requires thinking 2 or more moves ahead.

This was developed using React Native. To play this game you need to download the Expo app and scan this QR code

A simple npm module created to analyze a markdown file and detect broken links from alive ones. 

Developed through NodeJS this was the first project to not have a tangible interface which proved its own challenge. 

The usage is pretty straightforward: you enter the name of the file that contains the urls and it will return a list of which ones work and which ones don't.
